# Accountwide Systems

### Description

	Since I mainly use a repack instead of compiling with C++, here is my implementation approach
	to things Accountwide.

	Here are the Accountwide Lua Scripts that are included in this project:
	- Achievements
	- Currency
	- Mounts
	- Reputation

  	Each script has a module-like configuration where you can choose to enable/disable independently.


# Setup

- Copy the "AccountWide" folder into the lua_scripts folder on your server.
- If your server is already running, type ".reload eluna" in the worldserver window.  Otherwise, just start up the server.
